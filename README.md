Vehicle Zoo - Abstract Garage üöóüèçÔ∏èü¶Ö

Project Overview
This Python project simulates a simple vehicle garage using Object-Oriented Programming concepts like Abstract Classes, Method Overriding, Duck Typing, and Higher-Order Functions.
The program models different types of vehicles (Car, Motorcycle, Plane) with shared behavior and demonstrates dynamic behavior by passing functions as arguments and using the walrus operator for user input.

Features

Abstract vehicle actions: go() and stop() methods implemented differently by each vehicle class

Dynamic color assignment with customizable formatting (uppercase, lowercase, capitalized)

Use of higher-order functions and lambdas

Input handling with the walrus operator (:=) for concise code

Simple ‚ÄúFix‚Äù class that interacts with any vehicle object to perform actions
